            Hi everyone, <i>Julia</i> here! I am a third year Statistcs student
            minoring in Digital Humanities. I'm very much looking forward to this course because
            I've been meaning to make a website about myself, like a website resume, however I 
            had no idea how to start. Now I know! <br>
            I enrolled in this class though because I love making data visualizations, 
            especially spatial visualizations. 
            I have a Tableau Public page where I post these visualizations, 
            and am really eager to learn more about GIS 
            so I can expand my spatial visualization toolkit. 
            A little bit about me is that I love any activity that gets
            my <b>adrenaline</b> pumping. That's me!
        </p>
