## Week 6 Thinking Cap

#### What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"

Thick mapping differs from mapping in that it captures the past, present, and future whereas "mapping" just reflects current spaces. Thick mapping in general gives you  more information  about a  space and the  people that occupy  it than a regular, old map.

Quote: "the book brings together the methods, content, and values of the humanities to create and re-create representations of places, what we are calling 'thick mapping'" (7).

Furthermore, rather than maps being made by one person or a group of people to be distributed to the general public, thick maps can be informed by the people themselves through mapping of social media posts.

Thick maps bring maps to life with personal stories, pictures, documents and other primary sources geocoded to their location.

Every map makes an argument. Because every map has to distort a 3D world onto a 2D surface, therefore sacrificing size or direction. Maps are supposed to represent the physical world, but they are all influenced by the map  maker's perceptions and opinions about the world. 

Thick mapping strives to restore the power to the people that may not have had the authoritative power to construct maps. Show everyone's story, even  though this on the global scale is (dare I say) impossible. Now thick digital maps allow maps to be updated in real time, and directly reflect the changing world around us  ratehr than being stagnant. 

#### How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

Thick mapping aims to show connections between geographical spaces and human relationships/experiences that we might not otherwise be aware of.  Therefore thick mapping can show cultural movements that may be affecting your life or the lives of others around you, so you can be more aware of other peoples experiences in other places of your town, state, country, world. 

Thick mapping also strives to show the stories and lives of people from an area that might have been erased or silenced, perhaps allowing us to understand the native americans that lived on this land before us and the  systematic processes undertaken to devastate these communities.
